This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying Nigerian posts. It uses a fine-tuned transformer model (DistilBERT) to categorize posts from nairaland (a popular nigerian microblogging website) into predefined labels. The project includes scripts for training, preprocessing tools, A production ready ZenML + MLFlow pipeline, a REST API built with FastAPI, and an interactive demo using Streamlit.

## Live Demo

Here is a quick look at the Streamlit application in action. The app provides a simple interface to input text and receive a classification prediction from the model served by the FastAPI backend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps.

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Muyiiwaa/naijapost-classifier.git](https://github.com/Muyiiwaa/naijapost-classifier.git)
cd naijapost-classifier
````

**2. Environment Variables (.env_example):**
This project relies on environment variables for configuration and sensitive information (like API keys). An example file, `.env_example`, is provided to guide you.

  * Copy the `.env_example` file and rename it to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env_example .env
    ```
  * Open the newly created `.env` file and update the placeholder values (especially `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY`) with your actual credentials.
  * **Important:** make sure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

**3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
This project uses **UV** for package management. First, run `uv sync`, which creates a virtual environment with all the libraries available.

```bash
uv sync
```

Then, activate it.

  * On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  * On Windows:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**4. Install Dependencies:**
Install all the required packages from `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## How to Run

After setting up the project, you can run the individual components.

**1. Run the API Server:**
The FastAPI server exposes the model's prediction endpoint. Start the server using Uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8005
```

You can now access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8005/docs` and `http://127.0.0.1:8005/redoc`.

**2. Launch the Streamlit Demo:**
Run the Streamlit app in a separate terminal. The app will connect to the FastAPI server running in the background.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

**3. Model Training:**
The notebook `train.ipynb` contains the complete workflow for data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation. You can explore or re-run it using a Jupyter environment.
